App Idea:
A plant identification app that also serves as a reminder/advisor on taking care of personally owned plants. It would use machine learning algorithms to be able to identify a plant. Once identified, user can optionally mark it as their own plant to then receive advice and reminders. For example, user takes a photo/video of a plant. The app identifies the plant and provides the option to mark the plant as one user wants periodic reminders/advice on care, else will provide only basic information about the plant.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
A challenge was starting Step 3 since was unsure how to open Storyboard file and could not find Adjust Editor Optiobs button. Only when viewing the gif, I was able to find Assistent to proceed.
